# BurpRequestUtils
Burp extension to make extracting details from requests a bit easier

## TODO:
* Finish copy parameters function
* Tidy up the UI, maybe move to a sub menu
* Add more options for copying params, maybe copy as a single string, copy as CR delimited, copy just names
* Add support for selecting multiple requests
* Look into removing the port number from Copy URL
* Keyboard shortcuts?
* Come up witha less rubbish name
